### Project 2

Construction of a program in Logic Programming with Restrictions. 

Bosnian Snake:
Locate a snake (a 1 cell-wide single continuous path) in the grid whose head and tail are
given. The snake does not touch itself, even diagonally. Numbers outside the grid
indicate the number of snake cells in that row/column. Numbers inside the grid indicate
how many of the 8 cells around it are used by the snake.
